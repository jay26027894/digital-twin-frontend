## Features

- **AI-Driven Recommendations**: Generates personalized action plans via Cohereâ€™s NLP API.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Single-click insights with dynamic loaders and feedback.
- **Expandable Insight Panels**: Collapsible UI panels to control information depth.
- **Modern UI/UX**: Responsive design using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
- **Modular Architecture**: Reusable React components with a clear separation of concerns.



## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, MongoDB
- **AI Integration**: Cohere API
- **Development Tools**: Cursor, Claude, Windsurf for code refinement and prompt optimization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>=14.x)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB instance (local or cloud)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jay26027894/digital-twin-frontend.git
   cd digital-twin-frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Configure environment**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add required variables:
   ```bash
   REACT_APP_API_URL=<your-backend-url>
   REACT_APP_COHERE_API_KEY=<your-cohere-api-key>
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

5. Open your browser at `http://localhost:5173` to view the app.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the dashboard and upload or input your activity data.
2. Click **"Generate AI Suggestions"**.
3. View your personalized action plan in the expandable panel.

## Project Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ public/               # Static assets
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                  # Source code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/       # Reusable React components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/            # Custom React hooks
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/            # Page-level components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/         # API & AI integration logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ styles/           # Tailwind CSS config & globals
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ App.jsx           # Main app component
â”œâ”€â”€ .env                  # Environment variables
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind.config.js
â””â”€â”€ vite.config.js
```

## How It Works

1. User clicks **"Generate AI Suggestions"**.
2. A loading indicator (`"Analyzing Your Data..."`) is displayed.
3. Frontend sends data to the AI backend (Cohere API).
4. AI responds with structured recommendations.
5. Recommendations appear in an expandable, styled panel.

## Key Takeaway

This project demonstrates how AI agents (Cursor, Claude, Windsurf) can accelerate web development by automating code improvements, UI refinements, and prompt engineeringâ€”resulting in a faster, more efficient build process.
